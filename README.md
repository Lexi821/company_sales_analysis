### Project Overview
---

This data analysis project aims to provide insights into the sales performance of a company in the year of 1996-1998. By analyzing various aspects of the sales data, we seek to identify trends, make data-driven recommendations, and gain a deeper understanding of the company's performance.

### Data Sources

Sales Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "final_project_2M_cis467.xls" file, containing detailed information about each sale made by the company.

### Tools

- SQL Server - Data Analysis
- Tableau - Creating reports


### Data Cleaning/Preparation

In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:
1. Data loading and inspection.
2. Handling missing values.
3. Data cleaning and formatting.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer key questions, such as:

- What is the overall sales trend?
- Which category is the top seller?
- What are the peak sales periods?

### Data Analysis

Include some interesting code/features worked with

```sql
SELECT * FROM table1
WHERE cond = 2;
```

### Results/Findings

The analysis results are summarized as follows:
1. The company's sales are relatively stable, with a noticeable peak during the holiday season(Dec, Jan).
2. "Dairy products" is the best-performing category in terms of sales, quantity and number of customers.
3. The United States has the highest sales among all regions.

### Recommendations

Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions:
- Invest in marketing and promotions during peak sales seasons to maximize revenue.
- Focus on expanding and promoting products in Dairy products.
- focus on the U.S. market and increase promotion of high-selling products in this region, such as beverages and meat..

### Limitations

I had to remove all zero values from budget and revenue columns because they would have affected the accuracy of my conclusions from the analysis. There are still a few outliers even after the omissions but even then we can still see that there is a positive correlation between both budget and number of votes with revenue.
